## Introduction

I am Trang. I had undergrate program about Pharmacy in Vietnam. Then, I moved to US to pursue MPH program. Now, I am a second year PhD student in Epidemiology. I am interested in infectious disease epidemiology, particularly TB transmission. 

I took SAS computing and management two years ago with Dr. Song. Also, I had STAT6360E which teach partially about R and SAS in this summer, because I want to prepare myself for this class. I had some classes about biostatistics such as BIOS8010, BIOS8020, BIOS8030, and BIOS8110. The objective of this class is also my objectives. All of my analysis experience is in SAS. Now, I want to learn analysis in R.

## Linked website
When I do not know how to analyse data, UCLA resources are really helpful because they are easy to understand. (Maybe, it is not cool)
